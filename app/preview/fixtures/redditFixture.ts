\u20B920,000 a month into an RD at 7.25%. Auto-debit so you cannot sabotage yourself. That compounds to about \u20B91,23,000 in six months.

Your existing \u20B950,000 goes in upfront. By October that sits at roughly \u20B951,875.

Now the hard part. Cut \u20B95,000 a month from the Swiggy-and-subscriptions fund. You are averaging \u20B98,000 on eating out. Your kitchen is right there. That adds \u20B930,000.

Total: roughly \u20B92,05,000. A small buffer, because I know you.

Want me to set this up or are you going to think about it until the flights get more expensive?`;
